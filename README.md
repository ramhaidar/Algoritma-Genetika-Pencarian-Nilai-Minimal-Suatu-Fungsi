## Overview

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the x and y values that minimize the given mathematical function. It was developed as part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Telkom University.

## Features

-   ðŸ§¬ Genetic Algorithm implementation
-   ðŸ“Š Population-based optimization
-   ðŸ”„ Generational replacement model
-   ðŸ“ˆ Fitness evaluation
-   ðŸŽ¯ Elitism selection
-   âš¡ Efficient binary encoding/decoding

## Mathematical Function

The algorithm minimizes the following function:

where x and y are bounded within the interval [-5, 5].

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filzarahma/Algoritma-Genetika-Pencarian-Nilai-Minimal-Suatu-Fungsi.git
```

3. No additional dependencies required (uses only standard Python libraries)

## Implementation Details

The genetic algorithm implementation includes:

-   Binary chromosome representation
-   Population size: 10 chromosomes
-   Number of generations: 10
-   Crossover probability: 0.8
-   Mutation probability: 0.01
-   Roulette wheel selection
-   Single-point crossover
-   Binary mutation
-   Elitism selection

## Usage

Run the program using:

```bash
python code.py
```

The program will display:

-   Population details for each generation
-   Best chromosome in each generation
-   Final optimal solution with:
    -   Best chromosome representation
    -   Corresponding x and y values
    -   Minimum function value achieved
